# lm_qc_tools
Estimate extraction and diagnostic tools for R's lm and objects

Contains four functions: (1) for extraction of model estimates together with errors and confidence intervals, (2) for generation of a table with model fit quality features (residuals etc.), (3) a function generating classical QC plots with identification of significant model missfits and (4) a linear or generalized lienar model generator useful for serial modeling tasks.
